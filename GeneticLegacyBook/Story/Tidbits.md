## Progatonist names

Diana, Cate and Art are named after *Diana*, *Hecate* and *Artemis*, which are all goddesses that are often depicted as being three-in-one in their pantheons. Diana is a Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Hecate, who in turn is closely associated with Artemis, another Greek goddess. Diana, Cate and Art are all clones of Marie.
