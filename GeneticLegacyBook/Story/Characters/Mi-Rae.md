# Mi-Rae

## Backstory

Named Mi-Rae at birth, she is the natural daughter of Angela and Joon-Ho.
Her Korean name was considered foreign and weird, so people quickly started calling her Mary.
She was unfortunately hit by a car while she was playing on the street at age 5.
Joon-Ho, who oversaw the emergency surgery, had narrowly managed to keep her alive after the accident, but she has been in a coma ever since.
Angela and Joon-Ho love their daughter very dearly, and they provide her with the best medical help that they can afford to support her in her comatose state, in the unlikely event that she may wake up one day.

However, Joon-Ho and Angela could not live with the fact that their daughter would never live a normal life.
With Angela's expertise, they managed to create three undocumented human clones of Mi-Rae.
When the clones were viable, they were passed on to three couples, very close friends of Joon-Ho and Angela's, who could not conceive children but wanted to have kids.
This way, Joon-Ho and Angela could care for their own daughter while knowing that in some way or form, they have provided a life for her beyond her condition.
